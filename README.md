"# GOC_SLE_QUIZ_WEBAPP" 

main.js is the entry point. It runs first, sets up all the event listeners (like what happens when a button is clicked), and acts as the "conductor" that tells the other modules what to do.

quiz.js is the brain of the quiz. When you click a quiz button, main.js tells quiz.js to start. It handles fetching questions, tracking the current question, and calculating the score.

ui.js controls what you see. When quiz.js needs to display a new question or show feedback, it calls functions in ui.js. This file is solely responsible for manipulating the HTML to show and hide different elements.

scoreManager.js handles data. It saves, retrieves, and clears your quiz scores using the browser's localStorage.

config.js is a helper file. It stores constants and references to all HTML elements so you don't have to write document.getElementById everywhere.
